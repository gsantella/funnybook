Long long ago in the dark forest of Waldorf
There was an elephant with a neck tattoo that ate kittens for breakfast. His name is Paul. 
Paul had an amazing collection of high heels.
He was then sent to the funnyfarm.
He then fell in the well.
Then a rope fell down and he climbed up to meet the person that dropped it.
Where he found that his rescuer, a fabulous group of drag queens.
Who had proceeded to help Paul on his Kitten Eating Journey.
Paul was quickly accepted into the group of drag queens due to his amazing collection of high heels.
The queens adopted his kitten chomping habit and then went their merry way.
Suddenly, John Wayne rode in from the sunset on his trusty steed.  He stopped and looked at Paul.  "Now hold on there, Pilgrim."
To which Paul responded "I'm not saying I'm batman but you've never seen me and batman in the same place" and then he ran away.
Paul and his new drag queen cult set off to rule all of the land and eat any kittens that blocked their path. (Do they eat dogs too or just kittens??)
They eat both kittens and dogs
