Long long ago in the dark forest of Waldorf
There was an elephant with a neck tattoo that ate kittens for breakfast. His name is Paul. 
Paul had an amazing collection of high heels.
He was then sent to the funnyfarm.
He then fell in the well.
Then a rope fell down and he climbed up to meet the person that dropped it.
Where he found that his rescuer, a fabulous group of drag queens.
Who had proceeded to help Paul on his Kitten Eating Journey.
